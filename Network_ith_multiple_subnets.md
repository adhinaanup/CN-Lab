# Packet Tracer, DNS, and DHCP - Theory

## Packet Tracer
Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.

Packet Tracer supports an array of simulated Application Layer protocols, as well as basic routing with RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP.

## DNS (Domain Name System)
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying network protocols.

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a clientâ€“server architecture.

It employs a connectionless service model, using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is implemented with two UDP port numbers:
- **67** is the destination port of a server, and is used by the client.
- **68** is the source port used by the client to receive configurations from the server.
